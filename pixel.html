          <h3>Wake Me Up</h3>
          <p>Wake Me Up is an experimentation of the developers' vision towards art, music, narration and gameplay. This demo was created during the Game Endeavor game jam. This prototype was a part of the pre-production stage of a bigger more
            complex
            project called SemiColon. The ultimate aim of the project is to raise awareness on mental health issues, and through this prototype we were able to test some of our game mechanic ideas.</p>

          <p>The idea of SemiColon is to create a game, where the main character explores different emotions and face his demons, just to realize that all of
            those parts of him are what make him human and complete. The goal was to create a space where the player could feel safe and to understand that they are not going through their experiences and feeling their emotions alone.</p>
          <p>The inspiration behind this game was the story of the young student, Ming Mei, who took her own life on campus at Concordia University, after struggling
            with hopelessness, body image and self love. </p>
          <p>After this prototype, I decided that it's better to have the main character genderless, so that more players can relate to it and can better explore
            themselves while playing the game. </p>
