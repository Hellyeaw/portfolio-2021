          <h3>Flower Crown</h3>
          <p>Tazhib is a form of traditional persian and islamic art. It is a combination of geometry and ornamental motifs. We use this form of art to decorate books and sacred monuments! After Highschool, I got a job at a Persian Caf√©, this
            oppertunity helped me to connect back with my culture and my roots. During those years I felt the need to learn more about the art present in my home country, Iran, that is how I discovered Tazhib and fell in love with it. This painting
            is inspired by the colors of spring in Shiraz, my mother's hometown in Iran. Through this painting I have camptured my childhood memories and the images I remember by walking in the small alleys in Shiraz.</p>

          <h3>Margin of the Sky</h3>
          <p>The second painting is inspired by the mosques in Iran. The turquoise blue both refers to the domes of the mosques when looking up at them and also the sky. I have also used the cloud ornaments to implify this resemblence. The name is
            inspired by this resemblence, as it looks as if the ornaments painted inside the domes are decorating the sky, the same way Tazhib is used to decorate sacred books and objects. I extremly enjoyed this style of painting, as it is inspired
            by my own experiences and memories. In a way, it helps me to stay connected with a part of me that is not always accessible to me.</p>

          <h3>Bugs placed in space</h3>
          <p>In this project I tried to play with percpective, and I used different shades, pressures and sizes to create depth. My goal was to create a 3D effect on a 2D medium. My main struggle was while drawing the furthest bugs, as it was
            challenging to apply low pressure and use lighter shades, and still being able to draw the details. I used hatching and cross hatching to create different textures and this drawing is one of my largest ones and I found it very meditative
            and relaxing as I moved around the paper and as I added small details to my bugs.</p>

          <h3>Texture and Perspective Study</h3>
          <p>I enjoy incorporating textures into my drawing and I also like to be able to draw my subject fom different angles. I picked couple of objects around my house and tried to create their texture on paper by using different hatching
            techniques. I also drew an urban landscape and created depth and 2-point perspective by employing vanishing points and changing the size and placement of buildings. These technique help me to better envision a product from different
            angles and display of different textures that can be used as a reference for my other artworks and designs.</p>
