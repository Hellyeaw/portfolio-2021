          <p id="jjjjj">I always loved accessorizing my outfits, I believe jewelery can higlight the beautiful features of the body and an outfit. However, it can also be costly. One day when I was at work, I saw a customer with very uniqu earings
            and when I asked her where she got them from, she told me she made them and that I should try making my own too. So as I went home I took out the old jewelery that I was no longer using and found a long wire from my arts and crafts box.
            And, that is how I started making my own jewelery for the past couple of years. I eventually started using old fabrics, stones and clay in my designs.</p>

          <h3>Jewelery</h3>
          <p id="tools">Materials: wire, clay, stone, buttons, fabric</p>
          <p>In this collection, I present some of my favorite earing pieces that I created over the years. My goal was to not only save money but also recycle and reuse my old jewelery. The main challenge that I had was to shape the wires in smll
            hoops with only one tool that I couls find in my apartment. Also finding the perfect tempeture to cook the clay was also challenging. But overall I belive my efforts paid off as I recieved many good comments on my new pieces. By making my
            own jewelery I always have unique pieces.</p>

          <h3>Textile</h3>
          <p id="tools">Materials and Tools: yarn, knitting and crochet needles</p>
          <p>I also love to create my own clothing as much as possible. I have never been a fan of the latest trends and I try to not support the fast fashion. Therefore, I usually buy second hand cloths and try to modify them or modify my own cloths in a way that I like. I also try to knit or crochet small pieces of clothing. Here I have presented a Crop top that I knitted, and a scarf that I made for my mother on the Mother's Day. The scarf is made of tiny crochet flowers and it is inspired by one her childhood jackets.</p>
