          <p id="tools">Tools: Aseprite, Unity</p>
          <p>"Wake Me Up" is an experimentation of the developers' vision towards art, music, narration and gameplay. This demo was created during the Game Endeavor game jam. The theme of the game jam that we worked on was "Dreams / nightmares". Every creator had a week starting from January 3th to January 7th to create a game respecting the theme and submit it. It was my third time joining a Game Jam and I found the experience to be super fun and enjoyable.</p>

          <p>After brain storming and desiging the levels and challenges of the game, my team mate and I started focusing on our tasks. I used pixel art to create chracters and details that best presented our vision. I specially enjoy Game Jams because I get to experiment and learn new skills. One of the challenges that I encountered was to make a background that gave the impression that the game is in fact a dream, so I painted shadow effects behind the checkerboard background, but trying to match the frames and the speed of each shadow was specially challenging and rewarding.</p>
          <p>Another challenge was the short amount of time we had to execute our design, it really helped me to learn to prioratize my work load and to perform under pressure.</p>

        <p>"Wake Me Up" placed 16th overall among 77 entries. It also placed 7th for audio and 14th for Design. I found this game jam a unique experience, as it was not only fun and intresting, but I also learned a lot by experimenting and pushing my own limits.</p>
