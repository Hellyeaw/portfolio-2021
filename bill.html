          <h3>A UX project</h3>
          <p>In this project, my team and I focused on an app as an addition to the Maple Bank, to improve the banking experience for their clients. Based on the information and the personas provided for us, we realized that a lot of Maple bank users were looking for ways to save up their money for different reasons, such as education, travel, family, and housing. <br> So we decided to target the age group of 18-35 years olds who have no to little experience with saving and investment. </p>

        <div class="game-proj-2 show-on-scroll fade-in">
          <p> After reviewing the personas and conducting some interviews, we realized some of the user's main goals are to be able to have control over their finances, being able to customize their savings based on their income and their needs, and being able to trust the app and being able to see the progress of their account. Therefore, we created a list of what would make a banking experience better and whta would make it more difficult. </p>

      <section class="game-sec-one">
        <div class="game-proj-2 show-on-scroll fade-in">
          <p> During our brainstorm, we chose three target points to focus on in our design. The three points being: the user need to be informed about their options and encouraged to make a savings accont, they should have the ability to customize their savings accounts, and there should not be any hidden fees or any difficult vocabulary to make the experience easier and smoother. Afterwards, we created journey maps, User Flow, Crazy 8 and conducted user tests on our initial designs to find the issues in our designs.</p>

      <section class="game-sec-one">
        <div class="game-proj-2 show-on-scroll fade-in">
          <p> Some of the additions to our design after the user tests included adding tool tips to explain different features and adding some frames at the beggining of our app to help with the user onboarding and to inform the user of the app's goals and how they can use it's features to set and reach their goals. We also created a moodboard and gathered inspiration. We wanted to have choose our colors and our font in a way that would attract the age group we wanted to target and still look professional.</p>

      <section class="game-sec-one">
        <div class="game-proj-2 show-on-scroll fade-in">
          <p> So we decided to use the usual corporate colors used for banking apps such as blue and green, but also add some pastel colors and a touch of pink and red. For the typography, we chose Libre Baskerville and DM Sans; which have a nice contrast and also help us achieve the overall look and feeling we were looking for in our design.</p>

      <section class="game-sec-one">
        <div class="game-proj-2 show-on-scroll fade-in">
          <p> We continued the user testings every step of the way, to make sure the new additions were still aligned with our goals and to find any new issues. Our final design was a success as we were able to create the app that we were looking for. However, we only had a short period of tme to conduct our research and finalize our design, therefore we still had some ideas that we could work on! we learned a lot during this process, for example, the users don't always click on the buttons that we were hoping for, for which we added tool tips to direct the users towards the features that we wanted them to explore.</p>
